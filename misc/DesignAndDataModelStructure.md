# Design

The food delivery mobile application will have the following screens:

1. Login/Signup Screen: This screen will allow users to either log in to their account or sign up for a new account.

2. Home Screen: This screen will display a list of restaurants and their menus. Users can search for a restaurant or cuisine, view details about a restaurant, and add items to their cart.

3. Cart Screen: This screen will display a list of items in the user's cart, along with the total price. Users can modify their order, add a coupon code, and proceed to checkout.

4. Checkout Screen: This screen will allow users to enter their delivery address, choose a delivery time, and pay for their order.

5. Order Tracking Screen: This screen will display the status of the user's order, such as "Preparing", "Out for delivery", or "Delivered".

# Data Model

The data model for the food delivery mobile application will include the following entities:

1. User: This entity will store information about the user, such as their name, email, password, and delivery address.

2. Restaurant: This entity will store information about the restaurant, such as its name, location, and menu.

3. Menu Item: This entity will store information about a specific menu item, such as its name, description, and price.

4. Order: This entity will store information about an order, such as the user who placed it, the items in the order, the delivery address, and the status of the order.

5. Coupon: This entity will store information about a coupon code, such as its code, discount amount, and expiration date.

6. Delivery Time: This entity will store information about the available delivery times, such as the time slot and the maximum number of orders that can be delivered during that time.

That's a basic design for a food delivery mobile application with a data model. Of course, there are many more features that can be added to this application, depending on your requirements.
